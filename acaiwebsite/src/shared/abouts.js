Years ago on a trip to San Diego they went out for breakfast and both came across The Acai Bowl, something both have never heard of. They were amazed at how this wasn't just a basic smoothie, but a full breakfast meal in a bowl. It was not only delicious, but healthy and provided natural energy to start the day off right."

Like our name states, we are all about the neighborhood by using local ingredients, promoting local art, and using environmental friendly products to protect our neighborhood. After all, we are all part of the same community, so might as well enjoy life together."
